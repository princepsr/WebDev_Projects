            <p class="text">
                There is a very famous quote by Hellen Keller, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” An adventure is something
                challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and forces us to try new things.<br/><br/> The definition of adventure varies
                from person to person. It can best be described as, “The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which
                may also be dangerous or in favour.”

            <p class="text">
                Bicycles have become even more important in recent times. While they have been offering us many advantages for a long
                time, they are very vital now. It is because of the rate at which pollution is growing in the world, they offer a
                greener way to commute.
                <br /><br />
                In other words, bicycles do not require any petrol or diesel which harms our atmosphere. Further, it does not leave a
                carbon footprint as well. Thus, it is a great choice for everyone especially those who are environment-friendly.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                The pilot sits in a harness or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained
                by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the
                air flowing over the outside.
                <br /><br />
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though
                flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources
                of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on
                the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore.
                <br /><br />
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of
                boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia,
                paipo, and other such water craft.
